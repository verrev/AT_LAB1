Developed a simple example application for serving web for a user who wants to store messages.

Used tools:

	IDE: IntelliJ
	Language: Java
	Versioning: Git
	Git provider: GitHub
	Documentation written in: Notepad++
	APIs: Spring MVC
	Techniques used: KISS, YAGNI, CleanCode
	
Architecture:
	Three pages written in HTML and JSP:
		1) register
		2) login
		3) get-messages
		
	One class controls the logic (Spring controller): SiteController.
	This class serves all the pages and exchanges information between
	them.


	Code review: non-existant since the other team did not do the task.
